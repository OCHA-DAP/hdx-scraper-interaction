More than 140 participants from South Africa and Ethiopia already attended the first training on Friday, February 26.  The training, developed in partnership with Brown University’s Center for Human Rights and Humanitarian Studies, follows the World Health Organization’s guidelines and supports the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention’s (Africa CDC) COVID-19 deployment and vaccination strategy. The training includes a blend of online learning modules, materials for in-person trainings, and direct support to health facilities. Participants learn about proper vaccine storage, preparation, and administration. They are also trained on how to respond to questions and concerns raised by local populations. The training is developed in English and will be soon translated to French, Arabic, and Portuguese to target further participants across the continent. <a href=""https://www.projecthope.org/project-hope-and-partners-roll-out-covid-19-vaccination-training-in-over-20-african-countries/03/2021/"">More Information</a> </p>",,,,"COVID-19 Response","Non-USG Funded",,NFlanagan@interaction.org,Published

To complement its Emergency Social Cash Transfer program targeting food insecure and vulnerable households, GOAL partnered with UNICEF and Promobile, a private sector partner, to provide downloadable lifesaving nutritional videos, photos and recipes through WIFI-routers mounted on trucks to help ensure that infants and children from six months to two years benefit from a balanced diet. The preloaded information also encourage visits to local health facilities and share tips on food preservation and gardening. This approach was noted by a local nutritionist to be a different and fun way to inform busy parents and spread nutrition and health information more widely. <a href=""https://www.goalus.org/stories/how-technology-can-help-save-lives-in-zimbabwe/"">More information</a>.</p>",,,,"Global Health, Maternal and Child Health, Nutrition","Non-USG Funded",,bbestor@interaction.org,Published

Nearly two million Venezuelans have fled to Colombia in recent years to escape instability in Venezuela or to support the families they left behind. Facing the usual and significant challenges of Venezuelan migrants in Colombia, Eva is one of several thousand migrants and refugees that found support from GOAL and its Irish Aid-funded humanitarian aid program. In partnership with Terre des Hommes, GOAL reached 850 families living on the border with cash assistance allowing them to prioritize their own needs. Being unable to legally work, Eva used the support she received to start an informal business and support and reunite her family. <a href=""https://www.goalus.org/stories/goal-supporting-thousands-of-venezuelan-refugees-in-colombia/"">More Information</a>.</p>",,,,"Humanitarian Action","Non-USG Funded",,bbestor@interaction.org,Published
